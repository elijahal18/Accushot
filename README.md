Tracks values of a kicked soccer ball through openCV and python tools.  These values include distance velocity and accuracy. The initial project was through a webcam and the final project was through raspberry pi cameras.
The data processing code was used in both versions. And the main.py and webcam.py was used only for the webcam version.
