This was a project I worked on with a team of 4 from NYU. I did all of the code and worked on alot of the circuitry for the camera and vibration sensors. This project tracks values of a kicked soccer ball through openCV and python tools.  These values include distance velocity and accuracy. The initial project was through a webcam and the final project was through raspberry pi cameras and sensors.
The data processing code was used in both versions. And the main.py and webcam.py was used only for the webcam version.
The report displays images of the circuitry, 3d printed materials and a discription of the processes
